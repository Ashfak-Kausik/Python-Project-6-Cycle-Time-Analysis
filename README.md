# Python-Project-6-Cycle-Time-Analysis
Developing a Python program to analyze the cycle time of a manufacturing process, identifying bottlenecks and potential improvements.

Objectives:
1. Calculating the yield as the ratio of acceptable products to the total number of products.
2. Providing a clear summary of the manufacturing yield.

Design and Approach:
1. Implementing the yield calculation formula.
2. Allowing user input for the number of produced and acceptable units.
