# Python-Project-6-Cycle-Time-Analysis
Developing a Python program to analyze the cycle time of a manufacturing process, identifying bottlenecks and potential improvements.

Objectives:
1. Input data for different stages of a manufacturing process.
2. Calculating the total cycle time and identifying stages with the highest delays.

Design and Approach:
1. Calculating the total cycle time and finding the bottleneck process.
2. Visualizing the cycle times across different stages.
